Welcome to My MVC Test Project!

I intended to use MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture/structure for organizing my code.

- "index.php" is served as an entry point with modified ".htaccess" for clean and simple url (query string request).
- "static" folder contains assets ex. js css or images files.
- "pages" folder contains HTML content/page files.
- "models" folder contains files that related or directly do action with database.
- "controllers" folder contains files that receive request and give reponse to users.

My Web Page is splited in 2 pages earthquake and product you can view them by clicking the url on the top header menu.

Any questions about my code feel free to ask.
